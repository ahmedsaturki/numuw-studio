# NUMUW | نُمو

**Growth Systems Studio for Egyptian businesses, industrial companies and B2B teams.**

NUMUW is organized as a small digital business system, not a single landing page.

## Public layers

- **Website** - the primary brand and conversion page.
- **Landing Pages** - focused pages for services, offers and industries.
- **Tools** - self-service diagnostic, estimation and scenario calculators.
- **Products** - productized offers with scope and next steps.
- **Documents** - company profile, capability statement, proposal, onboarding, handover and terms.
- **Pages** - company, method, trust, case studies and contact.
- **Brand / Media / Resources / Insights** - supporting assets.

## Principles

1. Problem first.
2. Clear scope before implementation.
3. Test before handover.
4. Ownership and third-party costs are explicit.
5. No invented testimonials, client logos, ROI, revenue or performance numbers.

## Technology

Static HTML/CSS/JS. No framework, build step or runtime backend is required for the public site. Designed for GitHub Pages.

## Local run

Any static server works:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Validation checklist

- Check every hub and landing page.
- Test mobile navigation.
- Test language toggle where enabled.
- Test WhatsApp / phone links.
- Validate canonical URLs after the final domain is chosen.
- Run Lighthouse / Core Web Vitals on the deployed site.
- Validate structured data with Google's Rich Results Test.
- Submit the sitemap in Search Console after the public URL is final.
- Keep each page's canonical URL and its `sitemap.xml` entry in sync.
- Run `bash autoresearch.sh` and expect `issues=0` before publishing.

## SEO metadata

Every page carries the metadata a search engine needs to index it unambiguously:

- `<link rel="canonical">` on every page except `404.html`, pointing at its absolute
  `https://ahmedsaturki.github.io/numuw-studio/...` route.
- One `<script type="application/ld+json">` block per page, typed to what the page
  actually is — `Service` for offers and landing pages, `ItemList` for hubs,
  `WebSite` for the brand page, `AboutPage` / `ContactPage` / `HowTo` / `Blog` /
  `ImageGallery` where each fits, `WebPage` for `404.html` and the proof page.
- Schema `name` matches the page `<title>` except on the home page, where the
  block carries the short brand name `NUMUW | نُمو` rather than the longer tagline.
- `areaServed` is the plain string `"Egypt"`; the site is single-market.

Canonical URLs and `sitemap.xml` must change together. Adding or removing a page
without the matching sitemap edit will fail the quality check, by design.

## Quality harness

`bench/site-quality.mjs` is a dependency-free Node script that scores the static
site against 16 structural and SEO rules (R1-R16). It performs no network access,
reads no clock and no random source, so repeated runs are byte-identical.

```bash
bash autoresearch.sh        # or: node bench/site-quality.mjs
```

It prints three machine-readable lines on stdout and one `issues: <n>` line, and
reports every individual violation on stderr:

```text
METRIC issues=0
METRIC total_bytes=626913
METRIC html_bytes=204878
```

The stdout stream is four lines, not three: the three `METRIC` lines plus a legacy
`issues: <n>` line. That fourth line is required by the autoresearch runner, whose
`metric_grep` is `^issues:` and therefore cannot match the `METRIC issues=` form.
Both forms are always present and always agree.

Exit status is `0` whenever measurement succeeds, regardless of how many issues
are found; a non-zero exit means the harness itself failed (unreadable
`sitemap.xml`, failed walk). Rule detail lives in
`.autoresearch/engineering/numuw-site-quality/program.md`.

`total_bytes` counts every file the walk reaches, so it moves with untracked local
artifacts. Three build PDFs in the repo root (`NUMUW-*.pdf`, 164,523 bytes) swing
the metric from 464,502 to 629,025 with no tracked content changed at all. The
harness cannot distinguish tracked files from scratch files, and the evaluator is
deliberately not modified, so compare `total_bytes` only across runs with the same
working tree. Use `html_bytes` for content-level weight — it is unaffected by
non-HTML artifacts.

`issues` and `html_bytes` are both stable properties of the committed site.
`total_bytes` is a weight guardrail for this working tree, not a page-weight
metric.

## Brand clearance

Before major investment in **NUMUW / نُمو**, complete formal trademark, domain and social-handle clearance. The site intentionally does not claim that clearance is complete.

## Business documents

HTML business documents are print-ready. Release PDFs are generated separately and should be refreshed whenever the approved company facts, offers or contact details change.
